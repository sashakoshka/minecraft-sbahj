Sweet bro and hella jeff texture pack for minecraft

Adapted from [this pack](https://captainhoers.tumblr.com/post/27953210838/did-you-think-minecraft-didnt-look-enough-like), and updated to work in modern minecraft.

This is so much a work in progress.

## Build instructions

This repo comes with a handy Makefile to automate the install
(same as [minecraft-nord](https://github.com/sashakoshka/minecraft-nord))

* `make` or `make all` - Zips the pack
* `make clean` - Removes the pack from the directory
* `make install` - Zips the pack, and puts it in your resource packs folder. You will still have to manually select it in options.

Alternatively, you can just zip the files and install manually.
